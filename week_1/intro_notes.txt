Machine Learning 

1. Field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed 
2. Computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P, 
if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.


supervised learning --> regression or classification 
unsupervised learning --> finding structure in unlabelled data 

regression: continuous-value output
classification: discrete-value output
(a) Regression - Given a picture of a person, we have to predict their age on the basis of the given picture
(b) Classification - Given a patient with a tumor, we have to predict whether the tumor is malignant or benign.

Unsupervised learning example - clusters of similar genes
