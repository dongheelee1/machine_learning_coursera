logistic regression is a classification algorithm where the label y is a discrete value (linear regression, on the other hand, won't be a good idea since classification is NOT a linear function)

sigmoid function and logistic function are basically synonyms 

theta_t * x <-- linear regression function is the input for the sigmoid function


h(x) = p(y=1|x; theta) translates to probability that y=1 given x parameterized by theta
