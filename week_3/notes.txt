Hypothesis 

What is the hypothesis we are going to use when doing a classification problem?

Logistic Regression Model --> want the hypothesis value to be between 0 and 1 inclusive 
linear regression --> hypothesis took on the form theta-transpose * x 
logistic regression --> take a function of the linear regression hypothesis g(Z) = 1/(e^-Z+1)
  - sigmoid function
  - logistic function  
interpretation of hypotheis output: h(x) is the probability that y=1 on input x


Parameters theta determine the decision boundary
